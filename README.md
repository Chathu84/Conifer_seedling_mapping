This project uses UAS based RGB images and sfm based point clouds to map conifer seedlings in a mountainous terrain. 

## Data
The data includes;
  1. RGB image based indices
    ### List of indices used in this example:
  2. Point cloud based variables
    ### List of point cloud based variables:
  3. Texture base variables
    ### List of Texture based variables:


## Methods

This repository contains data and codes to implement simple machine learning algorithms (e.g. One-class classsification) to detect seedlings in coniferous forests using UAS based data.


## Findings
